# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a retail bank using transactional and customer profile data.  
The objective is to identify key factors associated with customer attrition and provide insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

The project follows an end-to-end data workflow: data cleaning and exploration using SQL, data profiling and analysis using Python, and interactive dashboarding using Power BI.
